# Solar System Visualization

This project is a 3D visualization of the solar system using React and Three.js. It displays the Sun and the planets orbiting around it with their respective names, distances, radii, and speeds of revolution. This was created entirely using Copilot prompts.

## Features

- 3D visualization of the solar system
- Realistic distances, radii, and speeds of revolution for each planet
- Interactive controls to explore the solar system
